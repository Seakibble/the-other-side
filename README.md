# The Other Side
A Star Trek inspired sci-fi roleplaying game where you play as an officer on a starship on an adventure. Currently in pre-alpha.

Based on [Drew Conley's Pizza Legend tutorial series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcjhmZ8oLT0r9dSiIK6RB_PuBWlG1KSq_&si=NID_6wVY4zKwtkHw).

## Key Features
Main features added beyond those developed in the tutorial series:
- Full audio integration (background music, SFX, etc.)
- Scripted camera controls during cutscenes.
- Functionality to have distinct character 'voices,' including unique SFX, text colour, display speed and font family for distinct characters.
- Ability to skip cutscenes.
- Main menu.

## Highlights
This project was really fun to work on. When I saw this series, I really wanted to follow it because the other web games I've made have all been roguelikes or platformers. An RPG was something very different, and I also wanted to see how someone else would go about architecting a game. This series was much more object-oriented than my designs tend to be, so it was very helpful getting more comfortable with that programming paradigm. While I have experience with object-oriented programming in C++, C# and Java, I have much less in JavaScript, so it was very interesting seeing what features now exist in JS that support that style of development.

My favourite bits were adding in audio integration, and extending the text display functionality. I found both of those very satisfying to implement. It required really understanding how the engine this tutorial creates needs to be extended. That said, the tutorial series is excellent, and at roughly the right level for me (definitely not aimed at beginners, but still develops everything from scratch so you can see exactly how everything is done). 

Overall, even though I reached a point where I stopped feeling motivated to develop content, I achieved all the technical features I wanted, and I'm very pleased with how it turned out.

## Technology 
- This project is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.
- Audio management is achieved with [Howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/)
- Music and SFX were created by me.
- Art assets are either made by me or are placeholders provided freely by the tutorial series.
